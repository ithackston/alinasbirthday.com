# Alina's Birthday Invitation Website

We went all out for Alina's first birthday. The guestlist got very long very quickly, and so we managed it like the wedding
we never had. It was an experience that we're not eager to repeat.

This website is the invitation we sent out, and it has a nicely embedded Google Form to accept RSVP. Now that the party is
over I am making this repository public to use as an example implementation of a simple static website that collects form
responses.
